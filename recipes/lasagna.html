        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Meat</span>: This super meaty
            lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Onion and garlic</span>: An onion
            and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of
            flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Tomato products</span>: You'll need
            a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of
            tomato paste.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sugar</span>: Two tablespoons of
            white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the
            sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Spices and seasonings</span>: This
            lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves,
            salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Lasagna noodles</span>: Use
            store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Cheeses</span>: Parmesan,
            mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Egg</span>: An egg helps bind the
            ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
          </li>
        </ul>
