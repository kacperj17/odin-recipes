        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
          This Texas-style pulled pork recipe has a tangy barbeque sauce that's
          easy to make in the slow cooker. I like to serve the shredded pork on
          toasted buttered rolls. My family's favorite!
        </p>
        <p>
          Making barbecue-restaurant-worthy pulled pork is easier to make than
          you think. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step
          instructions in the recipe below.
        </p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Oil</span>: This pulled pork recipe
            starts with a teaspoon of vegetable oil at the bottom of your slow
            cooker.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Pork</span>: If your pork shoulder
            roast is larger or smaller than four pounds, you'll need to adjust
            the ingredient rations and cook time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Sauces</span>: You'll need bottled
            barbecue sauce, yellow mustard, and Worcestershire sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Apple cider vinegar</span>: Apple
            cider vinegar adds brightness and cuts through the other rich
            flavors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Broth</span>: Use store-bought or
            homemade chicken broth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Brown sugar</span>: Light brown
            sugar lends warmth and sweetness.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Seasonings</span>: This flavorful
            pork is seasoned with chili powder, garlic, and dried thyme.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Onion</span>: A chopped onion gives
            the pork tons of flavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Buns and butter</span>: You'll need
            buttered hamburger buns if you plan to make pulled pork sandwiches.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Pour oil into the slow cooker, then place the roast on top of the
            oil.
          </li>
          <li>Add the remaining ingredients to the Crock-Pot.</li>
          <li>Cover and cook until the pork shreds easily.</li>
          <li>
            Shred the pork and return it to the slow cooker to combine it with
            the juices.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you're making sandwiches, serve the pulled pork on buttered buns.
          </li>
        </ol>
